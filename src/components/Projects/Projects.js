                  Since February 2024, I‚Äôve been developing a second-hand car
                  market website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently,
                  admins can upload cars, but I‚Äôm working on adding storage so
                  listings stay visible and sync across users. Be a tester by
                  logging in using Id and Pass - admin/admin123.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  üîê <strong>Upcoming Upgrades:</strong>
                  <br />‚û§ <strong>Storage Integration:</strong> Keep listings
                  accessible to all users.
                  <br />‚û§ <strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Strengthening
                  login protection.
                  <br />‚û§ <strong>Real-Time Sync:</strong> Ensure updated car
                  listings for everyone.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This project is still evolving, and I‚Äôm dedicated to making it
                  a secure, user-friendly marketplace. Stay tuned! üöÄ
